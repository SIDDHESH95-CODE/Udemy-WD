Prisma:
    - Prisma is an ORM(Object Relational Mapper).
    - It works with SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server.
    
Mongoose:
    - Mongoose is an ODM(Object Data Modelling).
    - Since MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Mongoose helps you structure your documents and interact with the database using an object-oriented approach.

-Note: Prisma is more focused on type safety and works better with TypeScript compared to Mongoose.
