Setting up EJS:
    - ejs basically works as a jsx only.
    - Just few steps required to perform this.

1. install ejs: npm i ejs
2. configure ejs in your index.js file: app.set("view engine", "ejs");
3. make a folder named by "views" and create your routing files inside the folder but with the .ejs extension only: views/index.ejs
4. create a route inside index.js file and while sending a response use render function: res.render();
5. inside res.render() mentioned your file name from views folder but without the extension as by default "views" folder contains only .ejs file: res.render("index") 
6. to get the value dynamically and display in your frontend then use <%=variable name%>
    eg. 
        JS:
        app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
            res.render("contact", {name: "Siddhesh"});
        })

        HTML:
        <h3>Get In Touch with <%=name%></h3>
