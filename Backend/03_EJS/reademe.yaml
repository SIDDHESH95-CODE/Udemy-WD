Setting up EJS:
    - ejs basically works as a jsx only.
    - Just few steps required to perform this.

1. install ejs: npm i ejs
2. configure ejs in your index.js file: app.set("view engine", "ejs");
3. make a folder named by "views" and create your routing files inside the folder but with the .ejs extension only: v iews/index.ejs
4. create a route inside index.js file and while sending a response use render function: res.render();
5. inside res.render() mentioned your file name from views folder but without the extension as by default "views" folder contains only .ejs file: res.render("index") 
6. to get the value dynamically and display in your frontend then use <%=variable name%>
    eg. 
        JS:
        app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
            res.render("contact", {name: "Siddhesh"});
        })

        HTML:
        <h3>Get In Touch with <%=name%></h3>


Static files setup:
    Folder structure
    -public folder
        -images folder
            .png files
            .jpg files
        -stylesheets folder
            .css files
        -javascripts folder
            .js files

    app.use(express.static("./public"));
    link the files to be used inside index.js file by providing their respective path but not to use /public as it will be by default added.


Express Generator setup:
    1. open cmd and come to the last folder
    2. install express generator globally once per machine
        npm i express-generator -g
    3. select a specific folder directly write below line to create express app
        express "app-name" --view=ejs
    4. then follow these steps: 
            select the app folder which created - cd/app-name
            install node - npm i
            open with vs code - code .
